# Additional resources

This is a collection of resources that have assisted me in learning
about the technological and musical concepts that led to the creation
of Rhapsody.

## Rhapsody

* To see the full collection of music-related functions made available
  to you, see:
  [live.clj](https://github.com/ben-denham/rhapsody/blob/master/src/cljs/rhapsody/live.clj)
* Read the (fairly minimal) source code itself to fully understand how
  Rhapsody works.

## Libraries used by Rhapsody

* [cljs-bach](https://github.com/ctford/cljs-bach)
* [leipzig](https://github.com/ctford/leipzig)
* [webmidi.js](https://github.com/cotejp/webmidi)

* [Write Like Mozart: An Introduction to Classical Music Composition](https://www.coursera.org/learn/classical-composition)
* [Tuts+: Composition](https://music.tutsplus.com/categories/composition)


## Sound synthesis

* [Clojure for the Brave and True](http://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/)
  * Technically Clojure, not ClojureScript, but good for learning the
    concepts that apply to both forms of the language.
* [ClojureScript Unraveled](https://funcool.github.io/clojurescript-unraveled/)
* [modern-cljs](https://github.com/magomimmo/modern-cljs)
  * The structure of the Rhapsody project was based on this guide.
